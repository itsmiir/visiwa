minecraft generates its worlds via random simplex noise-- i.e., there is no rhyme or reason to the placement of biomes, besides "dissimilar biomes should not be right next to each other." this mod changes that by generating worlds "top-down"; i.e., starting with a macroscopic global ccontinental map, and working downwards from there. elevation, temperature, humidity, continentiality, erosion, and weirdness (and therefore biome distribution) are determined by geographical factors such as latitude, proximity to oceans, placement of mountain ranges and rivers, and airflow.
