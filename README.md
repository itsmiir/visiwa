# visiwa

minecraft generates its worlds via bottom-up noise-- i.e., there is no rhyme or reason to the placement of biomes, besides "dissimilar biomes should not be right next to each other." this mod changes that by generating worlds "top-down"; i.e., starting with a macroscopic global biome map, and working downwards from there.
